                Founded by people with enthusiasm with programming, the CRHS
                Innovation and Development Association (IDEA) is an organization
                focused on advancing students beyond the school’s
                object-oriented programming to bring software development to
                Cinco Ranch High School students.

              A hackathon isn’t really what the name implies. While the term
              “hack” you are used to is the run of the mill usage of exploits,
              brute force, and malicious access to one’s advantage. Although
              this definition partially applies as some hackathons have capture
              the flag (finding an answer through hacking) competitions, it
              mostly implies “hack” as in life hacks. The main goal of the
              hackathon is the viability and execution of an idea. Think of this
              as a startup competition.

              There is no entry fee for this club. However, you will need a
              (non-ChromeOS) laptop as in-person hackathons do require you to
              have a computer that can run an Integrated Development
              Environment. If you cannot get a laptop, some hackathons have a
              loan system where you can borrow high performance laptops provided
              by sponsors of the event.

                  I’ll admit, I’m sort of amazed we haven’t covered this at the
                  HMS Jalopiesnick before, because this is precisely the kind of
                  automotive idiocy that gets all of my delight glands nice and
                  excorpulated. The car I want to tell you about isn’t a
                  particularly interesting car, but it was closely related to a
                  good, honest general-use car, the 2002 to 2004 Toyota Matrix.
                  You may also recall that the Toyota Corolla-platform’d Matrix
                  was also sold by GM, who built (at the joint Toyota-GM NUMMI
                  plant) a Pontiac-branded version called the Vibe. But did you
                  know these twins were actually triplets? The often-forgotten
                  sibling is called the Toyota Voltz, and it needs some
                  explanation.

                <span>CapsuleMap</span>
                <div class="projectinfoline"></div>
                <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                  Despite the confusing name, the Voltz was not electric, well,
                  no more so than any other car that has spark plugs and a
                  radio. The Voltz was just like the Pontiac Vibe, a slightly
                  re-styled and very re-badged Toyota Matrix. Now I bet you’re
                  already starting to notice something weird going on here. The
                  re-badged Toyota was...badged as a...Toyota?

                <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                  Yes, yes it was. And, even better, this re-badged Toyota was
                  actually a re-badge of the Pontiac, which was a re-badge of a
                  Toyota. I’ll give you a moment to mop up the brain-splatter
                  from your shirt and immediate area. For some deeply confusing
                  reasons, Toyota didn’t want to sell the Toyota Matrix in
                  Japan, but they were fine selling the mechanically-identical
                  but re-styled Pontiac Vibe there, only they couldn’t really
                  sell it under the Pontiac name there, since, you know, Toyota
                  isn’t Pontiac, so they re-badged the Vibe as the Toyota Voltz.

                <div class="projectinfoline"></div>
                <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                  They didn’t change anything about the Vibe’s styling at all,
                  so all of the GM-designed body panels, even the Pontiac’s
                  signature split grille, remained. Hell, even the shape of the
                  Pontiac logo remained, just replaced with a similar
                  Isosceles-triangle-shaped badge, but this time a “V” for
                  “Voltz” and definitely not “Vibe.” Weirdly, this is the second
                  time I can think of the Pontiac logo shaped being replaced
                  with another badge on an imported car sold as a Pontiac. The
                  Voltz was sold at Toyota’s Netz dealerships/stores, part of
                  Toyota’s kind of baffling differentiation of models into
                  different types of dealership outlets that I think target
                  different market segments, with Netz seeming to skew younger.
                  You can see the Netz branding in this bonkers Voltz commercial
                  that features weird, scary CG mannequins instead of actual
                  humans. Huh, it seems those mannequins were the work of an
                  artist named Eric So, so maybe that’s more of A Thing than I
                  realize.

                  The RHD interior seemed to pull more parts from the Matrix
                  than the Vibe, just to keep things nice and confusing. It’s
                  all so strange, and reveals so much about the inherent madness
                  of badge engineering. Because this strange ouroboros of a car
                  is a Toyota re-badged as a Pontiac re-badged as a Toyota. Has
                  there ever been another car to be badge-engineered back to its
                  origin company before? I don’t think so. So, everyone, take in
                  the majestic madness of the Toyota Voltz, and take some sort
                  of lesson from its example, somehow.

                I’ll admit, I’m sort of amazed we haven’t covered this at the
                HMS Jalopiesnick before, because this is precisely the kind of
                automotive idiocy that gets all of my delight glands nice and
                excorpulated. The car I want to tell you about isn’t a
                particularly interesting car, but it was closely related to a
                good, honest general-use car, the 2002 to 2004 Toyota Matrix.
                You may also recall that the Toyota Corolla-platform’d Matrix
                was also sold by GM, who built (at the joint Toyota-GM NUMMI
                plant) a Pontiac-branded version called the Vibe. But did you
                know these twins were actually triplets? The often-forgotten
                sibling is called the Toyota Voltz, and it needs some
                explanation.

              <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                Despite the confusing name, the Voltz was not electric, well, no
                more so than any other car that has spark plugs and a radio. The
                Voltz was just like the Pontiac Vibe, a slightly re-styled and
                very re-badged Toyota Matrix. Now I bet you’re already starting
                to notice something weird going on here. The re-badged Toyota
                was...badged as a...Toyota?

              <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                Yes, yes it was. And, even better, this re-badged Toyota was
                actually a re-badge of the Pontiac, which was a re-badge of a
                Toyota. I’ll give you a moment to mop up the brain-splatter from
                your shirt and immediate area. For some deeply confusing
                reasons, Toyota didn’t want to sell the Toyota Matrix in Japan,
                but they were fine selling the mechanically-identical but
                re-styled Pontiac Vibe there, only they couldn’t really sell it
                under the Pontiac name there, since, you know, Toyota isn’t
                Pontiac, so they re-badged the Vibe as the Toyota Voltz.

              <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
                They didn’t change anything about the Vibe’s styling at all, so
                all of the GM-designed body panels, even the Pontiac’s signature
                split grille, remained. Hell, even the shape of the Pontiac logo
                remained, just replaced with a similar Isosceles-triangle-shaped
                badge, but this time a “V” for “Voltz” and definitely not
                “Vibe.” Weirdly, this is the second time I can think of the
                Pontiac logo shaped being replaced with another badge on an
                imported car sold as a Pontiac. The Voltz was sold at Toyota’s
                Netz dealerships/stores, part of Toyota’s kind of baffling
                differentiation of models into different types of dealership
                outlets that I think target different market segments, with Netz
                seeming to skew younger. You can see the Netz branding in this
                bonkers Voltz commercial that features weird, scary CG
                mannequins instead of actual humans. Huh, it seems those
                mannequins were the work of an artist named Eric So, so maybe

            particularly interesting car, but it was closely related to a
            good, honest general-use car, the 2002 to 2004 Toyota Matrix. You
            may also recall that the Toyota Corolla-platform’d Matrix was also
            sold by GM, who built (at the joint Toyota-GM NUMMI plant) a
            Pontiac-branded version called the Vibe. But did you know these
            twins were actually triplets? The often-forgotten sibling is
            called the Toyota Voltz, and it needs some explanation.

            Despite the confusing name, the Voltz was not electric, well, no

            very re-badged Toyota Matrix. Now I bet you’re already starting to
            notice something weird going on here. The re-badged Toyota

            Yes, yes it was. And, even better, this re-badged Toyota was
            actually a re-badge of the Pontiac, which was a re-badge of a
            Toyota. I’ll give you a moment to mop up the brain-splatter from
            your shirt and immediate area. For some deeply confusing reasons,
            Toyota didn’t want to sell the Toyota Matrix in Japan, but they
            were fine selling the mechanically-identical but re-styled Pontiac
            Vibe there, only they couldn’t really sell it under the Pontiac
            name there, since, you know, Toyota isn’t Pontiac, so they
            re-badged the Vibe as the Toyota Voltz.

            They didn’t change anything about the Vibe’s styling at all, so
            all of the GM-designed body panels, even the Pontiac’s signature
            split grille, remained. Hell, even the shape of the Pontiac logo
            remained, just replaced with a similar Isosceles-triangle-shaped
            badge, but this time a “V” for “Voltz” and definitely not “Vibe.”
            Weirdly, this is the second time I can think of the Pontiac logo
            shaped being replaced with another badge on an imported car sold
            as a Pontiac. The Voltz was sold at Toyota’s Netz
            dealerships/stores, part of Toyota’s kind of baffling
            differentiation of models into different types of dealership
            outlets that I think target different market segments, with Netz
            seeming to skew younger. You can see the Netz branding in this
            bonkers Voltz commercial that features weird, scary CG mannequins
            instead of actual humans. Huh, it seems those mannequins were the
            work of an artist named Eric So, so maybe that’s more of A Thing
            than I realize.

            The RHD interior seemed to pull more parts from the Matrix than

            strange, and reveals so much about the inherent madness of badge
            engineering. Because this strange ouroboros of a car is a Toyota
            re-badged as a Pontiac re-badged as a Toyota. Has there ever been
            another car to be badge-engineered back to its origin company
            before? I don’t think so. So, everyone, take in the majestic
            madness of the Toyota Voltz, and take some sort of lesson from its
            example, somehow.

            I’ll admit, I’m sort of amazed we haven’t covered this at the HMS
            Jalopiesnick before, because this is precisely the kind of
            automotive idiocy that gets all of my delight glands nice and
            excorpulated. The car I want to tell you about isn’t a
            particularly interesting car, but it was closely related to a
            good, honest general-use car, the 2002 to 2004 Toyota Matrix. You
            may also recall that the Toyota Corolla-platform’d Matrix was also
            sold by GM, who built (at the joint Toyota-GM NUMMI plant) a
            Pontiac-branded version called the Vibe. But did you know these
            twins were actually triplets? The often-forgotten sibling is
            called the Toyota Voltz, and it needs some explanation.

            Despite the confusing name, the Voltz was not electric, well, no
            more so than any other car that has spark plugs and a radio. The
            Voltz was just like the Pontiac Vibe, a slightly re-styled and
            very re-badged Toyota Matrix. Now I bet you’re already starting to
            notice something weird going on here. The re-badged Toyota
            was...badged as a...Toyota?

            Yes, yes it was. And, even better, this re-badged Toyota was
            actually a re-badge of the Pontiac, which was a re-badge of a
            Toyota. I’ll give you a moment to mop up the brain-splatter from
            your shirt and immediate area. For some deeply confusing reasons,
            Toyota didn’t want to sell the Toyota Matrix in Japan, but they
            were fine selling the mechanically-identical but re-styled Pontiac
            Vibe there, only they couldn’t really sell it under the Pontiac
            name there, since, you know, Toyota isn’t Pontiac, so they
            re-badged the Vibe as the Toyota Voltz.

          <h1 class="projectinfoh1">
            They didn’t change anything about the Vibe’s styling at all, so
            all of the GM-designed body panels, even the Pontiac’s signature
            split grille, remained. Hell, even the shape of the Pontiac logo
            remained, just replaced with a similar Isosceles-triangle-shaped
            badge, but this time a “V” for “Voltz” and definitely not “Vibe.”
            Weirdly, this is the second time I can think of the Pontiac logo
            shaped being replaced with another badge on an imported car sold
            as a Pontiac. The Voltz was sold at Toyota’s Netz
            dealerships/stores, part of Toyota’s kind of baffling
            differentiation of models into different types of dealership
            outlets that I think target different market segments, with Netz
            seeming to skew younger. You can see the Netz branding in this
            bonkers Voltz commercial that features weird, scary CG mannequins
            instead of actual humans. Huh, it seems those mannequins were the
            work of an artist named Eric So, so maybe that’s more of A Thing
            than I realize.

            The RHD interior seemed to pull more parts from the Matrix than
            the Vibe, just to keep things nice and confusing. It’s all so
            strange, and reveals so much about the inherent madness of badge
            engineering. Because this strange ouroboros of a car is a Toyota
            re-badged as a Pontiac re-badged as a Toyota. Has there ever been
            another car to be badge-engineered back to its origin company
            before? I don’t think so. So, everyone, take in the majestic
            madness of the Toyota Voltz, and take some sort of lesson from its
            example, somehow.
